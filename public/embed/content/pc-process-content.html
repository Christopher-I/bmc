            <p>In the excitement of launching their companies, partners are often so eager to begin (and pressed for time) they short circuit this fundamental discussion. Exploring their ideas of where they each want the company to go and how it's going to get there is critical to ensure they're not excited about two slightly different businesses.</p>

            <p>What entrepreneurs refer to as "inevitable conflict" is the number one reason many people avoid partnerships. By taking an assessment, exploring each partner's conflict-handling style, and developing behavioral commitments to one another about how they'll communicate, they boost their confidence they can talk productively about their differences.</p>

            <p>Research has demonstrated that people imagine they know other people better than they really do and some people hold onto those misunderstandings. Digging into feedback from style assessments helps partners understand one another and helps them make behavioral commitments to one another so their day-to-day interactions are much more collaborative and satisfying.</p>

            <p>Dividing roles and authority is advantageous for both partners and the business itself. Using a detailed roles table and clear levels of authority, partners discuss responsibilities and carefully specify the levels of authority each partner will have for each of their responsibilities. The result is far fewer turf battles and misunderstandings.</p>

            <p>Many people say they avoid partnerships because partners so frequently complain about "unmet expectations," which can feel like breaking a trust. The problem is partners routinely fail to share their expectations with one another. When partners explore their expectations from a number of different perspectives, they reduce the risk of this problem and build greater trust.</p>

This unit sets up partners to "think the unthinkable" and become more confident they'll be able to handle whatever anybody – including their partners – might throw their way.

            <p>The concept of fairness is at the heart of all successful partnerships, but it's often taken for granted: we don't think about it until it doesn't feel equitable. Often, that's too late. Fairness discussions are hardwired into the PC process so partners have productive ways to think and talk about them.</p>
