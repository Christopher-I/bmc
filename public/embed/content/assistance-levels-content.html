        Partners can select the level of assistance that's best for them as they navigate the Charter process, from limited support, all the way to full, comprehensive guidance.

              Either one or two "Guides" (advisors who manage the entire process from start to finish) keep the partners progressing, make sure they don't skip over any sensitive or difficult conversations, document their understandings and agreements, and write and revise the Charter drafts.
            </p>
            <p class="assistance-section-text">
              The Guides also ensure partners thoroughly understand the complexity of their partnership, and the connections among the 13 critical elements.

            <h3 class="assistance-section-heading">Partially Guided</h3>
            <p class="assistance-section-text">
              Partners with limited financial resources, or a "do-it-ourselves" flair can elect to do some or all the work on their own. Partners use the same Workbook and templates, but must facilitate their own discussions and negotiations, and be responsible for drafting their Charter.
            </p>
            <p class="assistance-section-text">
              With a licensed PC advisor in the wings, partners do have the option of requesting facilitation with some of their negotiations, or converting to a Guided Charter if they get bogged down anywhere in the process. DYP allows that to happen seamlessly.
