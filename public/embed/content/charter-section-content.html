            A Partnership Charter (PC) is a breakthrough methodology for designing business partnerships. It's actually the only structured process that helps partners clarify both the business and interpersonal sides of their partnership.
          </p>
          <p class="charter-paragraph">
            Traditional Partnership Agreements are useful for protecting the rights of partners, but they serve a narrow legal purpose. PCs have a much broader goal, which is facilitating in-depth discussions that make it easy for partners to grasp the complexity of being partners. The Design Your Partnership™ tool contains workbooks, facilitates the discussions and negotiations, and helps memorialize the partners' understandings, commitments, and agreements in a 60–90 page Charter document.

            Charters notably lower the risks of having partners while significantly amplify the benefits.
